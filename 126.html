            There is a lot of precipitation in the city, very humid and not a lot of wind. There is not a lot of snow in the area (but htere is a lot of rain), which suggests the temperature of the area might be high. This suggest the test area should be no where near north and south pole. There are some month with heavy precipitation during winter, summer and spring, but there isn't heavy rain during fall.
